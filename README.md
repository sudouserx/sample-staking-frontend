# CampusCompass

Welcome to CampusCompass! This is a web application designed to help users navigate and find important locations on the campus of Hindustan University. The project consists of both frontend and backend code.

## Frontend

The frontend code for CampusCompass can be found [here](https://looking-for-frontend.vercel.app/). It provides a user-friendly interface where users can interact with the campus map, search for labs and cabins, and view important details about each location.

### Technologies Used

- React.js: The frontend is built using the React.js library, allowing for efficient component-based development and a smooth user experience.
- Material-UI: Material-UI is used for designing and styling the user interface, providing a clean and modern look to the application.
- Mapbox: The campus map is integrated using Mapbox, enabling users to visualize the locations of labs and cabins on the map.

## Backend

The backend code for CampusCompass can be found [here](https://github.com/sudouserx/looking_for_backend.git). It is responsible for handling data and serving API endpoints. The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

### Technologies Used

- Node.js: The backend is implemented in Node.js, providing a scalable and efficient runtime environment for server-side code.
- Express.js: Express.js is used as the web application framework to handle HTTP requests and define API routes.
- MongoDB: The data is stored in a MongoDB database, allowing for easy and flexible data management.
- Mongoose: Mongoose is used as the MongoDB object modeling tool, providing a schema-based solution for data modeling.

## Usage

To run CampusCompass locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the frontend repository from [here](https://github.com/sudouserx/looking-for-frontend.git) and install the frontend dependencies using `yarn`.
2. Clone the backend repository from [here](https://github.com/sudouserx/looking_for_backend.git) and install the backend dependencies using `yarn`.
3. Start the frontend server using `yarn dev` in the frontend directory.
4. Start the backend server using `yarn dev` in the backend directory.

Make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine.
